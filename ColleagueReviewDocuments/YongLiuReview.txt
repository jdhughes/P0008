Hi Joe,

I have read your manuscript. Here are my comments:

 It is a very well-written technical and research article with sufficient 
quantitative results and thorough discussion. I would recommend to be 
submitted for publishing as soon as possible. One thing that I would 
suggest to add is to say a few words about any possible future research 
(e.g., GPU cluster, Cloud-based GPU resources such as Amazon GPU cluster) 
and practical usage of GPU solvers for MODFLOW 2005 for real-world use 
cases (an example real-world use case that would benefit from using this 
research findings and the GPU solver would be excellent!). It would be 
also nice if the authors can indicate where and how to obtain the source 
code (will it be in public domain just like the MODFLOW source code?).

Regarding your code:
it would be nice if you could also provide the python code so that I or 
someone else can reproduce some of your experiments.

thanks and please let me know if the above review comments are ok.

-Yong

Yong, 

Thanks for agreeing to review our GPU manuscript. With regard to being an 
"internal reviewer" I guess the more accurate description is a colleague 
reviewer to satisfy our internal USGS review requirements. So from that 
standpoint it does not matter if reviewers are internal or external to the 
USGS. 
I have attached a pdf of the manuscript. 



I have uploaded the source code and Visual Studio 2008 project for the GPU 
code to: 
ftp://ftpext.usgs.gov/pub/er/fl/tampa/Hughes/GPU/ 

I can also provide the python code I used to create and run the problems 
described in the manuscript. 
BR 
Joe

Hi Joe,

Thanks very much for your message and I am glad to know that your work is 
finally done. I am sure this will have huge impact in both the Groundwater 
community and the GPU computing community. I'll be glad to be your 
internal reviewer (but I am an outsider of USGS, so why is this called an 
"internal reviewer"? :) ). I would be also glad to get a copy of your code 
and will certainly keep to myself and my group. If time permitting, we may 
explore the GPU cluster and other scenarios in the future.

Thanks,

-Yong

Yong, 

We have finally gotten our act together and have a manuscript that we are 
going to be submitting to Ground Water in the next week or so. We have 
implemented a polynomial preconditioner and have seen speedups as high as 
8 when compared to the standard MODFLOW PCG solver using the MIC 
preconditioner. A  few remaining things I would like to explore in future 
work is (1) extending the solver to multiple GPGPUs, (2) exploring 
possible parallelization of a MIC preconditioner, and (3) adding the 
ability to solve nonsymmetric matrices. 
At the USGS we also have to have an internal colleague review, which can 
be performed by people outside the USGS, and I was wondering if you would 
be willing to be one of our internal reviewers? 
I would be willing to provide you the current version of the code 
regardless of whether you agree to review the manuscript or not. If you 
would like to take a look at the code the only thing I would ask is that 
you and your group keep the code within your group. 
Hope all is well with you. 

Joe

Dear Joe,

Is there any update on the Modflow GPU solver at USGS? 

thanks,

Hi Joe,

Thanks for the information. Yes, I would be interested in following up on 
this GPU solver issue. We can start with testing the single GPU solver and 
then we can collaborate on supporting multiple GPUs.

Hi Yong, 

I was good talking to you as well. It would be great to collaborate on the 
GPU solver for MODFLOW. I am currently in the process of implementing a 
few polynomial preconditioners and hope to have them up an running on the 
CPU in 2-4 weeks. It will probably take a more few weeks to get them 
working with the GPU since we are balancing this effort with other work we 
are doing. At that point we would be able to let you test drive the single 
GPU solver. 
We would have to do some more work to support multiple GPUs. Maybe this is 
something you would be interested in working on. 
Right now the plan is to get a manuscript for the GPU solver together for 
Ground Water. We will probably limit it to what we have done so far plus 
the polynomial preconditioner work currently underway. If possible we will 
try and work with Alistair Black to include something on using the GPU to 
also assemble the matrix. We could also include a multi-GPU evaluation if 
we can get it done. My goal is to submit the manuscript to Ground Water no 
later that December 2011. 
And ultimately I want to implement other solver options for the GPU (e.g. 
BiCGStab) so we can solve nonsymmetric matrices on the GPU as well. 
Let me know if you guys are still interested. 

BR 
Joe

Hi Joesph, 

It was a pleasure to talk to you after your talk at the Modflow and More 
2011 conference yesterday. As I mentioned, I have been very interested in 
working on the GPU-based solver for Modflow for a while. Now that you have 
started this work, I wonder if it is possible for us to get involved. We 
have a GPU cluster for research & Development ( 
http://iacat.uiuc.edu/resources/cluster/ ) and a much larger scale NCSA 
supercomputer "Lincoln" ( 
http://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/UserInfo/Resources/Hardware/Intel64TeslaCluste
r/ ). 
Initially, maybe we can help test what you already have and then we may 
move on some co-development effort. 
Please let me know. 

thanks, 

-Yong
