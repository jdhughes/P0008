We greatly appreciate the comments provided by the associate editor. We have addressed all of the comments in this document. Associate editor comments are included (\textit{in italics}) prior to our responses. 

\section*{Associate Editor's Comments:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textit{Line 89-90 "function" (singular) or delete "a" if you want plural}

Revised to singular "function" and "kernel".

\item \textit{Line 104 - CCFD is not defined yet (I assume you mean cell centered finite difference)}

CCFD is defined in the second sentence of the introduction.

\item \textit{Line 144 - axpy is not defined yet. Maybe a sidebar could be used for a quick description of BLAS and you could move material from line 156-157 there too?} 

Added definition of \texttt{axpy}. Did not add another sidebar for a description of BLAS and BLAS routines because we do not believe it would improve the readability of the manuscript.

\item \textit{Line 196-199 - this sentence seems incomplete to me. After "problem" maybe insert the word "was designed" or "was created" or something similar.}

Corrected the sentence.

\end{enumerate}
